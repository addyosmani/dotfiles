# Matt's dotfiles.

This repo contains my personal dotfiles and are heavily based on [Addy's](https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles/) and [mathias](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/)'s.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gauntface/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install-deps.sh && ./sync.sh
```

To update later on, just run the sync again.

## Differences....

None yet - such a noob.
