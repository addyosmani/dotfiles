# Matt's dotfiles.

This repo contains my personal dotfiles, I've pilfered a few bits from
 [Addy's](https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles/) and
 [Mathias's](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/)'s.


## Installation

It's important to run the right command depending on the platform.

There is specific aliases and set up process for installing default apps and
aliases for each platform - so be warned.
